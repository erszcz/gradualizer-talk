# Gradualizer - a gradual type system for Erlang

This is a talk I prepared for
[the January 2019 edition of Erlang/Elixir Krak√≥w Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Elixir-Krakow/events/257965594).
I'm **not** the author of [Gradualizer](https://github.com/josefs/Gradualizer) - credits
go to Josef Svenningsson and the project team attracted by his idea.

These slides are created with [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1) - a
presentation tool using HTML5+JavaScript.
To view them, please follow the steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/erszcz/gradualizer-talk
cd gradualizer-talk
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```

And open `localhost:8080` in your browser. Alternatively, you can just
browse `slides.md` which is the Markdown source of the slides.
It's readable, but GitHub doesn't render it accurately due to some Remark syntax.
